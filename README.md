# projects-basics

This is the first Java project I developed as an exercise for the knowledge I was getting on a course I paid myself. I'm using it as a presentation and also as a tool to get familiar with github.

The project is an introduction to Java as a language used in Android Programming (my final aim). It is an application with a command line that executes only certain order formats (reflected on the InstruccionEnConsola class)

Although I wasn't a programmer, I made the change to this job since 2013 for personal reasons. Im still looking for a chance to grow up in the skills I need to develop. I had some idea of programming but decided to finally make it my career for I wanted to improve in this area

Thank you very much for your time!
